### Learn Go Fast API

This basic API was created while following along with this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/8uiZC0l4Ajw?si=3cq2pciOerMs1Np5). I found it pretty helpful, though a lot of it went over my head. I enjoy learning by doing, and Go is going quite well. Yes, that was a pun.

I will be writing about my entire Go learning process in my digital garden soon, and will add the link here.
